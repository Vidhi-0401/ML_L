# ML_L

1-> house -3 error line - Linear Regression
2->Linear and Pllynominal Regression 
___-> spam email -> Naive Bayes Algorithm
3-> App Suggetion -> Decision Tree 
4-> University Acceptance -> *Logistic Regression ->one line look data and cut it ->detect error - log-loss function 
* Neural Network -> x (cross)- 2 or more line to cut data

Linear Optimaization -> Support Vector Machines 

*kernel Trick -> 3 palte -> second plate with error 

5-> clustering
